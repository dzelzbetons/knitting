# Code & knitting

This repository contains various R scripts I've made for use in my knitting.


Dice roller is a simple script that randomly generates a number from 1-6 and prints ASCII art of a die with the number.
I created this to knit dice roller socks, where I determine the number of rows for each stripe by rolling a die.
